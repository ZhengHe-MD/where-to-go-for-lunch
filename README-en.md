# where-to-go-for-lunch

[Chinese](./README.md)

When I was woking in DingHao Electronics Building, where many restaurants resides in, it was hard to decide where to go for lunch. One day, I developed this app to help us make the decision.

Now, I don't work there any more and almost forget this app. Recently, I found this app when cleaning my projects. I think it is interesting so I put this on github and host it with github pages, in memory of the old days.
